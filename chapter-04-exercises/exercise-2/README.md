# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.


| Course Name | Course Number | Instructor |
| :-----------| :-------------| :----------|
| **Technical Foundations**  | _INFO 201 B_ | Thomas Winegarden |
| **Databases and Data Modeling** | _INFO 330 A_ | Greg Hay |
| **Beginning Scientific Computing** | _AMATH 301 B_ | Craig Gin |
| **Undergraduate Seminar** | _CSE 492 J_ | Kim Nguyen |
